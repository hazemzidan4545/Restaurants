# PAYMENT HISTORY TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

## Issues Fixed ✅

1. **Database Schema Issues**:
   - Fixed `current_user.id` → `current_user.user_id`
   - Fixed `current_user.is_admin` → `current_user.is_admin()`
   - Fixed `Payment.customer_id` → `Payment.order.user_id`
   - Fixed `Payment.created_at` → `Payment.timestamp`

2. **Template Field Issues**:
   - Fixed `payment.customer` → `payment.order.customer`
   - Fixed `payment.payment_method` → `payment.payment_type`
   - Fixed `payment.id` → `payment.payment_id`

3. **Missing Model Relationship**:
   - Added `customer` relationship to Order model

## Current Status

The payment history route should now work without database errors. However, if you're still seeing "no payments", it could be because:

### Possible Causes:

1. **No Payments in Database**: The user you're logged in as might not have any payments
2. **Wrong User**: You might be logged in as an admin or different user
3. **Test Data Missing**: The database might not have any payment records yet

### Debugging Steps:

1. **Check Current User**:
   - What username are you logged in as?
   - Is it a customer account?

2. **Check Database**:
   ```bash
   python show_payment_data.py
   ```
   This will show all users and their payments.

3. **Create Test Data**:
   ```bash
   python create_payment_test_data.py
   ```
   This creates a customer with payment history.

4. **Manual Database Check**:
   ```python
   from app import create_app
   from app.models import Payment, Order, User, db
   app = create_app()
   with app.app_context():
       print(f"Total payments: {Payment.query.count()}")
       print(f"Total orders: {Order.query.count()}")
       print(f"Total users: {User.query.count()}")
   ```

### Test Account Credentials:

After running the test data script, login with:
- **Username**: `john_customer`
- **Password**: `password`
- **Role**: customer
- **Should see**: 3 payments in history

### Admin View:

Admins see ALL payments from ALL users. If you login as admin, you should see every payment in the system.

### Next Steps:

1. Run `python show_payment_data.py` to see current database state
2. If no payments exist, run `python create_payment_test_data.py`
3. Login as the test customer account
4. Navigate to Payment History
5. Should see 3 test payments

## Template Access Pattern (Fixed)

The template now correctly accesses:
```html
{{ payment.payment_id }}          <!-- Payment ID -->
{{ payment.amount }}              <!-- Amount -->
{{ payment.payment_type }}        <!-- Payment method -->
{{ payment.status }}              <!-- Status -->
{{ payment.timestamp }}           <!-- Date/time -->
{{ payment.order.customer.username }} <!-- Customer name -->
```

## Route Query (Fixed)

For customers:
```python
payments = Payment.query.join(Order).filter(
    Order.user_id == current_user.user_id
).order_by(Payment.timestamp.desc()).all()
```

For admins:
```python
payments = Payment.query.order_by(Payment.timestamp.desc()).all()
```

The error should be resolved. If you're still seeing "no payments", it's likely a data issue, not a code issue.
